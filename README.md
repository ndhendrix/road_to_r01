Code to accompany the Substack entry of the same name.

Briefly, I was curious to see whether early career K awards from the NIH affected your odds of getting an R01.

There's a strong apparent impact of K awards, but there's a real problem with identifying their counterfactual effect. When you take into account that they correlate with ambition and talent, I'm suspicious that they improve your odds of an R01 independently (although the data are open to interpretation!).
